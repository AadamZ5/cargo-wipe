# TODO

## v0.1.0+
- Handle access denied errors
- Validate that `target` folders are indeed Rust folders
- Show total space made available in GB, when it makes sense
- Show before and after path size
- Show the actual dir size on disk
- Add flag that allows the exclusion of recent targets from the wipe (e.g. `-d 30` will wipe everything that hasn't been touched in 30 days)
- Add wipe confirmation prompt
- Add argument to allow disabling colors
