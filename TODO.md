# TODO
- Show total space made available in GB, when it makes sense (https://crates.io/crates/number_prefix)
- Show before and after path size
- Show the actual dir size on disk
- Add flag that allows the exclusion of recent targets from the wipe (e.g. `-d 30` will wipe everything that hasn't been touched in 30 days)
- Add argument to allow disabling colors
- Add support for other languages build directories

## Under consideration
- Allow the use of multiple subcommands at the same time
- Add wipe confirmation prompt
